Description: Signed HTTP Exchange toolkit library.
 Signed HTTP Exchange(SXG) is file format which contains an HTTP exchange
 (request and response) signed by a publisher's origin.
 https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-http-origin-signed-responses-06
 If the publisher creates an SXG file with a valid signature, it will be
 treated like a valid HTTP response regardless of the distribution channel.
