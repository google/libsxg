Signed HTTP Exchange library
-----------------

Signed HTTP Exchange(SXG) is file format which contains an HTTP exchange
(request and response) signed by a publisher's origin.
If the publisher creates an SXG file with a valid signature, it will be treated
like a valid HTTP response regardless of the distribution channel.
